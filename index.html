            Hello! Welcome to My Coding Portfolio! I hope you enjoy your stay here. My name is Jocelyn Chang and I graduated from
            UC San Diego with a B.S. in Biology. I started my coding journey with the language R in a biostatistics class in college.
            I was captivated by the power of coding and its ability to analyze and sort data. I think the best part is its ability to 
            break down the most complicated of problems into blocks of logical solutions. I treaded along the coding path by taking a class in C
            and self-teaching myself some Java. Now, I am partaking in the wonders of a coding bootcamp to solidify my basic knowledge
            of coding for web developers. My journey is far from over, but that is the best part. I can't wait for the lifetime of learning.

            Onto some personal facts about me. I am both an American and Taiwanese, leaning more on Taiwanese. This is because
            despite my American accent, I actually received the majority of my education back in Taiwan (from 5th grade to high 
            school). Thus, Taiwan will always have a special place in my heart. I am the type of person that will always think the 
            glass is half-full. Don't let my bubbly personality and easy going attitude fool you, once I set my eyes on the goal 
            I am determined and will not stop until I am there. I am always looking to meet new people and hear your stories. Let's connect.
